        I have little idea on how to make a good website with HTML/CSS, so apologies in advance for any goofies and sillies.

    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! It is still in development, so if something seems off, thats probably normal :)</p>
    <p>I initially started this project out for everything I'm doing in <a href="https://hackclub.com/arcade">Hack Club's Arcade</a> (which you can find <a href="arcade-projects">here</a>), but instead I'm going to use this website to talk about anything that I am working on (most notably swerve for FTC).</p>
