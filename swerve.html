            Printing Prototypes and Jigs - 6.24.2024
        </summary>
        <p>Hello to my first blog for swerve! My team has some of the parts we need for swerve, but I want to be ready when we do get the rest of the parts for efficiency testing, so I'm going to be designing and printing out a test jig for it in advance (today). I will update this when I have a design finalized, sliced the model, and finally printed it.</p>
