            Printing Prototypes and Jigs - 6.23.2024 to 6.24.24
        </summary>
        <p id="blog-text">
Hello to my first blog for swerve! My team has some of the parts we need for swerve, but I want to be ready when we do get the rest of the parts for efficiency testing, so I'm going to be designing and printing out a test jig for it in advance. I will update this when I have a design finalized, sliced the model, and finally printed it.
        <br><br>
Update: I was unable to print, but here is a picture of the assembly with the part I am going to print.

The way this works is that there are 4 different c2c distances for gears and 2 of them connect to one bigger gear. It is connected to the bigger gear so that I can frame count via a slow-motion video if a RPM meter is inaccurate.
