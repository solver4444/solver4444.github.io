I thought it would only be fitting that I start this blog with this website itself. Like I said <a href="./">on the home page</a>, I started this project because I was bored and was inspired by <a href="https://iris-therainbow.github.io/">Iris's website</a>, and thought it would be a good idea to get some experience into HTML/CSS/JS. It hasn't been the most smooth process as I'm trying to stitch together a website without very little prior knowledge about HTML and am relearning what I did know. <br>
I keep coming back to improving it and spending more time though because I really enjoy the idea of doing what I'm doing right now - just writing all my thoughts in a blog. The next features you can be expecting are a search bar to search blog posts and actually updating the home page with other non-related blog posts.
